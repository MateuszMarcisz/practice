cw = """Introduction

The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.

The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced. (Source Wikipedia)

Task

In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up. 

Rules

 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat

Example

wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

Good luck and enjoy!"""

"""The Story:

Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
Task Overview:

You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

    cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
    on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
    wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.

If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
Usage Examples:

cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

"""

    return on + wait - cap if on + wait > cap else 0


"""The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

"""Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

# must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200})
# must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000})
